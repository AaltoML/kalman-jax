# kalman-jax
Approximate inference for Markov (i.e., temporal) Gaussian processes using iterated Kalman filtering and smoothing. Developed and maintained by [**William Wilkinson**](https://wil-j-wil.github.io/).
The Bernoulli likelihood was implemented by **Paul Chang**. We are based in [**Arno Solin**](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s machine learning group at Aalto University, Finland.

This project aims to implement an XLA JIT compilable framework for inference in (non-conjugate) Markov Gaussian processes, with autodiff using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

The methodology is outlined in the following paper:  
* W. Wilkinson, P. Chang, M. Riis Andersen, A. Solin. **State Space Expectation Propagation: Efficient Inference Schemes for Temporal Gaussian Processes.** *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020* [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05994)

More details about the variational inference method are given in the following paper:  
* P. Chang, W. Wilkinson, M. E. Khan, A. Solin. **Fast Variational Learning in State-Space Gaussian Process Models.** *International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP), 2020* [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04731)

## Getting started
 - Install the latest version of jax and jaxlib (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for full dependencies)
 - We have lots of [**demo notebooks**](./kalmanjax/notebooks/) which cover many different tasks and modelling scenarios.

## Info

### We combine two recent advances in the field of probabilistic machine learning:
 - Development of state space methods for linear-time approximate inference in Gaussian processes
 - The ability to JIT compile and autodiff through loops efficiently with JAX

### Code structure
Each approximate inference algorithm will call the same underlying Kalman filter and smoother methods, and will be distinguished by the way in which the approximate likelihood terms are computed.
